It seems impossible to get the Cymbol grammar as defined in the book to work 
with named channels.

First antlr throws this error:

error(177): Cymbol.g4:60:30: WHITESPACE is not a recognized channel name
error(177): Cymbol.g4:63:33: COMMENTS is not a recognized channel name

Adding a channels block only then gives this error:

channels {WHITESPACE, COMMENTS }

error(164): Cymbol.g4:10:0: custom channels are not supported in combined grammars


Seperating out the lexer and parser into seperate grammrs one finds that one 
cannot import the lexer into the parser (which makes no sense).

Following the advice here (https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1555)
and replacing the lexer import statement with this one gets antlr to at least
generate some code:

options { tokenVocab = CymbolLexer; } 

Even then one then gets this and the parser and lexer do not work properly.

antlr4 Cymbol.g4 CymbolLexer.g4
warning(125): Cymbol.g4:8:9: implicit definition of token ID in parser
warning(125): Cymbol.g4:41:8: implicit definition of token INT in parser

However, simply replacing the channel names with integer literals seems
to work:


WS  :   [ \t\n\r]+ -> channel(1) ;    // channel(WHITESPACE)

SL_COMMENT
    :   '//' .*? '\n' -> channel(2)   // channel(COMMENTS)
    ;
