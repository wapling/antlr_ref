1) antlr4 -Dlanguage=Cpp Java.g4
2) There appears to be a bug in the C++ generation.  Some java code is generated in the middle of the
file JavaLexer.h, just after the destructor:
 
    protected boolean enumIsKeyword = true;
    protected boolean assertIsKeyword = true;

This needs editing to the C++ equivalent:

protected:

  bool enumIsKeyword = true;
  bool assertIsKeyword = true;  

Failure to change this will cause compilation to fail.

3) make
4) ./example Demo.java
